Contact App

Intent of this project was to learn MEAN stack by building an application. MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js. 

Basically this app uses BootStrap themes to look pretty and fluid. Front end uses AngularJS to mind view with model and controller makes REST call to server written in Node.js. Finally, data is persited using MongoDB. 

Here we have simple Object caller Contact and this app provides full CRUD operation and back by REST calls to backend.
